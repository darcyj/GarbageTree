# GarbageTree
A program to make de novo phylogenetic trees out of un-alignable sequence data. This method is in need of validation. If someone has an alignment of fairly divergent sequences (i.e. the most different phylotypes are >25% different), I'd love to use those data to validate GarbageTree. Maybe if it works, this program will get a new name. For now, it's "GarbageTree" for obvious reasons. 

GarbageTree requires the following:
* Vsearch installed on the system (https://github.com/torognes/vsearch)
* R package "data.table"
* R package "phytools"
* R package "ape"

I've only tested this program on OS X and on Ubuntu 16.

To get started, look in the "example" folder, which contains step-by-step code for using GarbageTree. 

Please email me with any questions, comments, harrassment, or data sets that could be good for validating this method.
